## About

io-myo contains bindings to the *Myo SDK* for the [Nim](http://nim-lang.org)
programming language. The Myo is a gesture control armband that lets users
wirelessly control a computer by detecting electrical activity in arm muscles.

## Supported Platforms

io-myo was last built and tested with **Myo SDK 0.8.1** and
**MyoConnect 0.9.1**. The bindings currently support the following platforms:

- ~~Android~~
- ~~iOS~~
- ~~MacOS X~~
- Windows


## Prerequisites

### MacOS X

Download and install the latest *MyoConnect* software from the Thalmic Labs
download page, as well as the *Myo SDK for Mac* from the Thalmic Labs developer
portal.

TODO

### Windows

Download and install the latest *MyoConnect* software from the Thalmic Labs
download page, as well as the *Myo SDK for Windows* from the Thalmic Labs
developer portal. Copy the `myo32.dll` and/or `myo64.dll` files from the SDK
into your program's directory.


## Dependencies

io-myo does not have any dependencies to other Nim packages at this time.


## Usage

Import the *libmyo* module from this package to make the bindings available
in your project:

```nimrod
import libmyo
```

This package also contains the types needed for the official Myo Bluetooth API.

```nimrod
import myohw
```

Please note that Bluetooth communication itself is not included - a separate
library for Bluetooth Low Energy is required for the desired target platform.
